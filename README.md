### Ismail Khan here, welcome to my GitHub.

I'm a Toronto-based front-end web developer. I hold a B.Comm in Business Management, I've tenured as an accountant and ecommerce specialist. Now I love to build amazing web applications and using my skills to make the internet a better place. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js, Node.js, further my knowledge of ES6, and mastering modern responsive layouts with CSS and Sass. 
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects, and I'm looking to mentor interested folks just getting started with web development. 

I'm looking for new opportunities as a full-time Front-End Developer. You can reach me at me[at]ismailkhan.io to setup a conversation.
